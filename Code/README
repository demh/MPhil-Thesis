Description of the files.

===============================

--> running_caveman.

caveman_wrapper_final_MT_script.sh: main script used to call SNVs in the mitochondrial genome using CaVEMan. This script was run for each one of the 40 samples, generating 40 VCF output files.

flag.to.vcf.convert.ini: file which contains the description for the different filters implemented in CaVEMan.

flag.vcf.config.ini: file which contains the whole list of parameters used when running CaVEMan.

===============================

--> filtering_pipeline.

final_MT_pipeline_commands.R: script which contains the commands for the processing and filtering of the SNVs in the mitochondrial genome, taking as input the VCF files from CaVEMan. 

final_MT_pipeline_functions.R: script which contains the functions used by final_MT_pipeline_commands.R.

baf_plots_Devil_unfiltered.R: script which creates BAF plots for the unfiltered SNVs found by CaVEMan in the mitochondrial genome.

baf_plots_Devil_filtered.R: script which creates BAF plots for the filtered SNVs after running final_MT_pipeline_commands.


===============================

--> doc_plots.

GenerateBedFile_Devil.R: script to generate the BED file which specifies the genomic windows for PlotCoverage_Devil_final.R.

PlotCoverage_Devil_final.R: script for creating the DOC (depth of coverage) plots for the Tasmanian devil samples.
